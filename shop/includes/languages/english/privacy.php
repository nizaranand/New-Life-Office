    <strong>What Personal Information About Customers Does LDS Greats  Gather?</strong><br /><br />
  The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and  continually improve your shopping experience at New Life Office. Here are the  types of information we gather.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong>&nbsp;We receive and store any information you enter on       our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide       certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of       many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such       purposes as responding to your requests, fulfilling orders, customizing       future shopping for you, improving our store features, and communication       with you.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic Information:</strong>&nbsp;We receive and store certain types of information       whenever you interact with our website. For example, like many web sites,       we sometimes use &quot;cookies,&quot; and we obtain certain types of       information when your Web browser accesses our website.</li>
  <li><strong>E-mail Communications:</strong>&nbsp;To help us make e-mails more productive to       improve service and your shopping experience, we sometimes send you       newsletters of our services and products, notifications of changes to our       policies, and order confirmations. If you do not want to receive e-mail       from us, other than order notifications and receipts, please adjust your       &quot;Subscription&quot; preferences by logging into your account.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What About Cookies?</strong><br /><br />
  Cookies are alphanumeric identifier text files that we transfer  to your computers hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to  recognize your browser and to provide features such as storage of items in your  Shopping Cart between visits.<br /><br />
  <strong>Does New Life Office Share the Information It Receives?</strong><br /><br />
  We respect your privacy and appreciate your business. At no time  do we ever provide your account contact or payment information to any third  party vendor, associate or service provider unless absolutely neccessary in  order to complete your transaction and order.<br /><br />
  <strong>How Secure Is Information About Me?</strong><br /><br />
  We work to protect the security of your information during  transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts  information you provide to us for purchasing of our products or services. We  reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an  order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate  credit card company during order processing. It is important for you to protect  against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to  sign off when finished using a shared computer by clicking the &quot;log  off&quot; link located in the side menu.<br /><br />
  <strong>Which Information Can I Access?</strong><br /><br />
  New Life Office gives you access to a broad range of information  about your account and your interactions with us for the limited purpose of  viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information.<br /><br />
  <strong>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</strong><br /><br />
  If you choose to visit New Life Office, your visit and any  dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use,  including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of  the law of the state of our local state. If you have any concern about privacy  of your personal information as used and collected within our website, please  send us a thorough description by clicking on the &quot;Contact Us&quot; link  on the side menu, and we will try to resolve it.<br /><br />
  Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the  Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our  notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should  check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise,  our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you  and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never  materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of  customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected  customers.<br /><br />
  <strong>Information You Give Us</strong><br /><br />
  You provide most such information when you search, buy, order,  post reviews, or other methods of communication via our website or email to New  Life Office. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such  information as your name, address, and phone numbers, and credit card  information.<br /><br />
  <strong>Automatic Information</strong><br /><br />
  For security purposes New Life Office sometimes collects and  analyzes the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to  the Internet, and to our website. This is done for your protection for tracking  purposes in the unfortunate event that someone gains access to your personal or  financial information and opens an account, or makes purchases under your name.<br /><br />
